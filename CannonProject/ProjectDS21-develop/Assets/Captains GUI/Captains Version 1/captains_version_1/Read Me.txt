Just a set of UI Elements for a trading/economy/rpg game with a renaissance theme.

All elements are sliced png files from the PSD files I have provided.
This is only a skin, so the coding needs to be on your side.

I have sliced the elements, but if you find something inproperly sliced,
please feel free to use the PSD files.

This UI contains not only the user interface, but also a Splash Screen and
a Loading Bar.

You can arrange the scenery in the Splash screen however you like.
